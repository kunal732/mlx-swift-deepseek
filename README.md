# DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B in Swift with MLX Model Manager

This Swift app demonstrates running the [DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B Model](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B) locally using [MLX Model Manager](https://github.com/kunal732/MLX-Model-Manager). The app also integrates [SwiftMarkdownUI](https://github.com/gonzalezreal/swift-markdown-ui) to render model-generated responses in a clean, readable format.

> **Note**: Still trying to figure out a good way to classify the thought portion of model output vs the answer.
